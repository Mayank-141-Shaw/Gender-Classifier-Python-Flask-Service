This is a python microservice for gender classification.

The other microservices are going to call the api of this service by sending their requests with an image payload and then this service would primarily return a response by identifying the gender of the image, i.e. ( MALE | FEMALE ) otherwise it would return NOT APPLICABLE for images its not able to classify with good accuracy.

A service which uses Flask API for hosting the app and handling API requests.
